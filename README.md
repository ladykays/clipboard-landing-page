## My process 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5


### What I learned

I had the chance to implement and apply several concepts that I've recently learned, including creating sections and leveraging Bootstrap 5. Moreover, I made a conscious effort to organize my code in a clear and understandable manner, ensuring it can be easily understood by fellow developers.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reset](https://medium.com/swlh/css-reset-2b4831d4664e) - This helped me with CSS reset. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
